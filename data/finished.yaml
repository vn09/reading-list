  quotes:
    - page: "I.18"
      content: All warfare is based on deception.
    - page: "III.18"
      content: "Hence the saying: If you know the enemy and know
        yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If
        you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained
        you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor
        yourself, you will succumb in every battle."
    - page: "V.15"
      content: Energy may be likened to the bending of a crossbow;
        decision, to the releasing of a trigger.
    - page: "IX.24"
      content: Humble words and increased preparations are signs that
        the enemy is about to advance. Violent language and driving
        forward as if to the attack are signs that he will retreat.
    - page: "VI.1"
      content: Whoever is first in the field and awaits the coming of
        the enemy, will be fresh for the fight; whoever is second in the
        field and has to hasten to battle will arrive exhausted.
    - page: "X.31"
      content: If you know the enemy and know yourself, your victory
        will not stand in doubt; if you know Heaven and know Earth, you
        may make your victory complete.
